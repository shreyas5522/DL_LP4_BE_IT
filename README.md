| Assignment |
|------------|
| Study of Deep learning Packages: Tensorflow, Keras, Theano and PyTorch | Document the distinct features and functionality of the packages. |
| Implementing Feedforward neural networks with Keras and TensorFlow | 
  - Import the necessary packages
  - Load the training and testing data (MNIST/CIFAR10)
  - Define the network architecture using Keras
  - Train the model using SGD
  - Evaluate the network
  - Plot the training loss and accuracy |
| Build the Image classification model by dividing the model into following 4 stages |
  - Loading and preprocessing the image data
  - Defining the model’s architecture
  - Training the model
  - Estimating the model’s performance |
| Use Autoencoder to implement anomaly detection. Build the model by using |
  - Import required libraries
  - Upload / access the dataset
  - Encoder converts it into latent representation
  - Decoder networks convert it back to the original input
  - Compile the models with Optimizer, Loss, and Evaluation Metrics |
| Implement the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Model. Stages can be |
  - Data preparation
  - Generate training data
  - Train model
  - Output |
| Object detection using Transfer Learning of CNN architectures |
  - Load in a pre-trained CNN model trained on a large dataset
  - Freeze parameters (weights) in model’s lower convolutional layers
  - Add custom classifier with several layers of trainable parameters to model
  - Train classifier layers on training data available for task
  - Fine-tune hyper parameters and unfreeze more layers as needed |
